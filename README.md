# Logistics-Transportation-Analysis

## Introduction 
From an industry-wide perspective, disruptions in transportation and logistics contribute to supply chain disruptions, increased operational costs, and inefficiencies in freight movement. Whether in road, rail, air, or sea transport, delays can lead to congestion at ports and distribution hubs, increased fuel consumption, and higher carbon emissions, further impacting environmental sustainability.

Understanding the key factors contributing to disruptions is crucial for developing strategies to minimize their impact. Therefore, In today's fast-paced supply chain industry, optimizing shipment efficiency, reducing delivery times, and enhancing operational visibility are critical for success. **The goal of this project is to explore and derive actionable insights** from a real-world logistics tracking dataset, featuring shipment records, GPS tracking, vehicle information, and transportation distances.
