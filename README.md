# Logistics-Transportation-Analysis

## Introduction 
From an industry-wide perspective, disruptions in transportation and logistics contribute to supply chain disruptions, increased operational costs, and inefficiencies in freight movement. Whether in road, rail, air, or sea transport, delays can lead to congestion at ports and distribution hubs, increased fuel consumption, and higher carbon emissions, further impacting environmental sustainability.

Understanding the key factors contributing to disruptions is crucial for developing strategies to minimize their impact. Therefore, In today's fast-paced supply chain industry, optimizing shipment efficiency, reducing delivery times, and enhancing operational visibility are critical for success. **The goal of this project is to explore and derive actionable insights that drive decision making** from a real-world logistics tracking dataset, featuring shipment records, GPS tracking, vehicle information, and transportation distances.

## Strategy Implemented üéØ 

To effectively analyze the Logistics & Transportation data and provide actionable insights, I followed a systematic approach:
   1. **Business and Data understanding:** I started with making research on logistics processes, understanding the key [business questions](https://github.com/Ben-Joan/Logistics-Transportation-Analysis/blob/main/Intro%20%26%20Brief_Challenge%2024_English.docx) and Exploring the metadata and [data](https://github.com/Ben-Joan/Logistics-Transportation-Analysis/blob/main/Transportation%20%26%20Logistics%20Tracking%20Dataset.xlsx) to understand data structure and contents.
 
   2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** By removing duplicates and unnecessary columns e.g (Driver No), creating new columns both calculated and conditional colums, and creating a star schema model of the data. ![Image](https://github.com/Ben-Joan/Logistics-Transportation-Analysis/blob/main/ERD.PNG)

   3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring the data, creating dax measures for key metrics and analyzing the data to answer the key business questions thereby identifying patterns and insights from the data.

   4. **Dashboard Development:** To visualize these insights effectively, I built a dynamic dashboard. The dashboard allows the monitoring of logistics performance and identifies delay causes.

   5. **Suggestions for Improvement:** Finally, based on the data analysis, I provided suggestions and strategies for reducing delay rate and optimizing efficiency.
